# README.md generator 
  
  ## Description

  This project will create a "README.md" file off of user input. This project was created with JS, Node, and the inquirer package. As a developer I was able to get a better understanding of how packages work and how to create files. 

  This is not a licensed project, I included that portion of the "README.md" to show it worked.

  ## Installation
  
  Go to this link https://github.com/nathansabin/README.md-generator and clone the repo to a folder. move over to the file and run "node.js".

  ## Usage

  Fill out the prompt making sure if you used a license to only use MIT, Apache, or GNU. The only other thing is to move the README.md file to the desired location.
  
  ## Credits
  
  I set up the license functions, the template, the package,  the questions, the file creation and finished the init function.
